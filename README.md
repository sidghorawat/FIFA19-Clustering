# Unsupervised Learning - FIFA 19

## Summary of The Problem
In professional football, it is not uncommon for a player to drop out of team due to contract transfer, contract expiration or medical reasons. By the means of our analysis, we tried to find suitable replacements players based on their skillset, strength and physical attributes. We performed Clustering Analysis which, an unsupervised learning method and built two different models using K-means clustering and Hierarchical clustering and in the end compared both the models to see which one performs better.

## Methodology
The methodology involved cleaning the dataset and then splitting it in 2 parts - Goalkeeprs and Outfield Players. And then by only taking the physical attributes into consideration , performing clustering analysis - K-Means Cluster Analysis and Hierarchical Analysis on both of the datasets separately to cluster similar physical type of player together and making it easier for the team management to find a suitable replacement in case of contract transfer, contract expiration or medical reasons.

## Implication of the Analysis
This will be useful for team management as it will narrow down their search for a suitable replacement.
